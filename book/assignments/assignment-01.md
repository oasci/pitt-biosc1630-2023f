## Objective

This assignment aims to practice skills in effectively reading, comprehending, and engaging with research literature in computational biology.
By analyzing a selected research article, you will practice identifying key components, addressing challenges, and building a deeper understanding of the content.

## Select article

Choose one article from the list below to complete this assignment.

- Wicky, B. I. M., Milles, L. F., Courbet, A., Ragotte, R. J., Dauparas, J., Kinfu, E., ... & Baker, D. (2022). Hallucinating symmetric protein assemblies. *Science*, *378*(6615), 56-61. DOI: [10.1126/science.add1964](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add1964).
- Cess, C. G., & Finley, S. D. (2020). Multi-scale modeling of macrophage—T cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment. *PLoS computational biology*, *16*(12), e1008519. DOI: [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008519](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008519).
- Sahlin, K., & Mäkinen, V. (2021). Accurate spliced alignment of long RNA sequencing reads. *Bioinformatics*, *37*(24), 4643-4651. DOI: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btab540](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab540).

## Instructions

### Pre-reading reflection

This pre-reading section serves as a mental warm-up, priming you for active reading and engagement.
It helps put you in the right mindset to digest the scientific article.

First, read only the title and write **one paragraph** about your prior knowledge.
Even if you are unfamiliar, write any supporting knowledge you could use to build off when reading the article.

:::{admonition} Motivation
Keeping up-to-date with literature means quickly determining if an article is worth reading.
Tons of papers come out daily, and most RSS feeds only provide the title.
To orient myself, I make a quick judgment call based on the title, if the article is relevant, and how long it would take me to understand it.
:::

### Active reading

Active reading involves engaging with the text purposefully and interactively to enhance comprehension and retention.

Read the article from start to finish.
While reading, **write down unfamiliar terms and concepts** you encounter.
Also, **provide the definition or explanation**.

After every few paragraphs, stop reading and reflect.
Then, write one sentence to describe your takeaway in your own words.
You can put these into a **list with at least eight bullet points**.

```{attention}
I am not requiring you to comprehend everything in the article fully.
(If you do, great!)
Your reflection does not need to be scientifically correct---just what you understand.
For example,

> - The authors are motivating why they choose ___ methods.
>   They cite other studies that demonstrate that it is appropriate for this system because of ___ reasons.

is a valid reflection.
```

### Contextualize

Seeing where the article fits into its scientific field helps understand its contribution better.

Pick one reference in the introduction that the article appears to build upon.
Explain in one or two paragraphs **how this article advances or continues from the reference**.

Pick another article that cites your article and **explain why they mentioned it** in one or two paragraphs.

```{important}
Make sure you cite these other articles!
```

### Challenges

What challenges did you encounter when reading this article?
For example:

- Was there a sentence or paragraph that was difficult to understand?
- Was the connection between a result and conclusion unclear?
- Were there any methods that did not make sense?

You must write **at least one paragraph**.

## Submission

You may write in a word processor of your choice: [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [typst](https://typst.app/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/), etc.
However, you must submit your assignment as a PDF in [Canvas](https://canvas.pitt.edu/).

## Formatting

Here are the guidelines for formatting your writing.

- **Page:** Use standard letter-sized paper (8.5" x 11").
  Set margins to 1 inch on all sides.
- **Font:** Use a legible font such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri.
  Use a font size of 12 points for all text.
- **Spacing:** Use 1.5 spacing for the entire document, including the main text, headings, and references.
- **Paragraphs:** Align text to the left margin (ragged right).
  There should be a blank line between paragraphs.
- **Headings:** Headings should be concise and bolded.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in font usage, heading styles, spacing, and formatting throughout the document.
- **Citations:** All citations must be in the APA format.

```{note}
I am being specific in the formatting guidelines so you do not have to make a decision/worry about it.
No points will be deducted if there are deviations from the format, like 0.75" margins or 1.0 spacing.
I will allow you to resubmit the assignment if your submission is unreadable or incomprehensible; otherwise, I will treat it as late.
```

## Grading

**Points:** 5

The assignment is graded entirely based on the effort you put into addressing the prompts and demonstrating your engagement with the article.
You will earn full points if you genuinely attempt to comprehend the content and fulfill the requirements.

While this grading focuses on your engagement with the content, we acknowledge the importance of effective writing style and grammar in communicating your ideas.
Therefore, we will provide feedback on writing style, grammar, and organization through comments.
These comments will help you improve your communication skills and will not affect your assignment grade.
