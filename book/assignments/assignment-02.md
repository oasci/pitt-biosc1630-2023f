## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to help students develop the skills necessary to identify and propose relevant scientific articles in the field of computational biology that will serve as the basis for their upcoming literature review and presentation.

## Instructions

In this assignment, your task is to identify and select **two distinct scientific articles**.
One of these articles will be the primary focal point for your upcoming literature review and presentation.
Each of your proposed articles need to meet the following criteria:

- A substantial portion involves computational biology.
  It can have some experimental data, but that should not be the article's primary focus.

  :::{tip}
  How can you tell if the primary focus is experimental?

    - The vast majority of the methods describe experimental procedures in detail.
    - Most tables and figures are data from assays, imaging, etc.
    - Computational results seem to be tacked on at the end to support or enhance their experimental work computationally.

  For example, [this article](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88229.2) has a healthy amount of experimental and computational methods and data.
  Their use of computational methods is at the forefront of their results.
  Another example [here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90773.2) applies computational techniques for structural insight into protein.
  These would be acceptable papers.

  An unacceptable paper would be [this one](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.08.017).
  Their main objective is the genetic manipulation of Patescibacteria.
  They do use computational methods such as AlphaFold, but this is supplementary to their main purpose.
  :::

- Published after January 1st, 2020.
- Has been cited at least two times according to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).

:::{attention}
Remember that your review paper will be between 7 and 9 pages, and your presentation is for 20 minutes.
Ensure that your articles have enough content, background, results, and future work to talk about.
:::

Please rank them from most to least desired articles.
I will review your top choice and ensure it will be sufficient for your review and presentation.
Otherwise, I will have to select one of your other two options.

### Summarize

**For each selected article, provide a concise rationale of at least 100 words** explaining the reasoning behind your choice.
This rationale should include

- the article's significance within the realm of computational biology,
- and a brief yet informative summary detailing the article's primary research question or objective.

### References

Include an annotated reference list of at least **two** primary literature references from each selected article.

:::{tip}
Here is an example of an annotated bibliography.

1. Hay, S. I., Rogers, D. J., Randolph, S. E., Stern, D. I., Cox, J., Shanks, G. D., & Snow, R. W. (2002). Hot topic or hot air? Climate change and malaria resurgence in East African highlands. *TRENDS in Parasitology, 18*(12), 530-534.

> This paper argues that temperature has not changed significantly and that factors other than climate - such as drug resistance and land use change - are responsible for the increased malarian incidence.

2. Stern, D. I., Gething, P. W., Kabaria, C. W., Temperley, W. H., Noor, A. M., Okiro, E. A., ... & Hay, S. I. (2011). Temperature and malaria trends in highland East Africa. *PloS one, 6*(9), e24524.

> This paper argues that mean temperatures have increased significantly from 1950-2002, though there are areas of Africa where malaria has decreased while the temperature increased.

3. Zhou, G., Minakawa, N., Githeko, A. K., & Yan, G. (2004). Association between climate variability and malaria epidemics in the East African highlands. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 101*(8), 2375-2380.

> This paper argues that climate variability has a more significant impact on malaria incidence than mean temperature change.

## Submission

You may write in a word processor of your choice: [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [typst](https://typst.app/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/), etc.
However, you must submit your assignment as a PDF in [Canvas](https://canvas.pitt.edu/).

## Formatting

Here are the guidelines for formatting your writing.

- **Page:** Use standard letter-sized paper (8.5" x 11").
  Set margins to 1 inch on all sides.
- **Font:** Use a legible font such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri.
  Use a font size of 12 points for all text.
- **Spacing:** Use 1.5 spacing for the entire document, including the main text, headings, and references.
- **Paragraphs:** Align text to the left margin (ragged right).
  There should be a blank line between paragraphs.
- **Headings:** Headings should be concise and bolded.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in font usage, heading styles, spacing, and formatting throughout the document.
- **Citations:** Any and all citations must be in the APA format.

```{note}
I am being specific in the formatting guidelines so you do not have to make a decision/worry about it.
No points will be deducted if there are deviations from this format, like 0.75" margins or 1.0 spacing.
I will allow you to resubmit the assignment if your submission is unreadable or incomprehensible; otherwise, I will treat it as late.
```

## Grading

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria.

- **Clarity and thoughtfulness (2.0 points):**
  We will assess how clearly and thoughtfully you explain your rationale for choosing each scientific article and its relevance to computational biology.
  Ensure that your explanations are concise, well-structured, and demonstrate why you made each selection.
- **Identification of key information (1.5 points):**
  This criterion focuses on the completeness and accuracy of the information you provide for each selected article.
  Include the title, authors, publication source (including journal and publication date), and a brief summary of the article's primary research question or objective.
- **Selection of additional literature (1.0 points):**
  We will evaluate the relevance and appropriateness of the additional primary literature articles you suggest for each selected article.
  These additional articles should enhance your understanding by providing valuable context and background information.
- **Grammar and writing quality (0.5 points):**
  This aspect concerns the overall quality of your writing, including grammar, spelling, and sentence structure.
  Ensure that your assignment is well-written and free from significant language errors.
  Properly proofread and edit your work to maintain clarity and professionalism.
