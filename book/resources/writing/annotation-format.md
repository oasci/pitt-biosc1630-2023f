# Annotation format

We will use the following annotation categories for writing critique and feedback.

- <span style="background-color: #ff9999; font-weight: bold;">Mechanics:</span>
    Issues related to grammar, punctuation, spelling, and scientific understanding in the writing.
- <span style="background-color: #99eba4; font-weight: bold;">Organization:</span>
    Problems include disorganized thoughts, unclear progression of ideas, or sections that may not flow smoothly.
- <span style="background-color: #fce680; font-weight: bold;">Constructive feedback:</span>
    Constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.
- <span style="background-color: #80d0ff; font-weight: bold;">Style:</span>
    Comments on the stylistic elements of the writing, including choice of words, sentence structure, and overall tone.
- <span style="background-color: #ffc0f2; font-weight: bold;">Plagiarism:</span>
    Text is heavily quoted from another source.

I will explain the meaning behind the first annotation, but subsequent ones will just be highlighted.
