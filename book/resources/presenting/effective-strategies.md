# Effective strategies

TODO: Add more

## One idea per slide

It is helpful to have each slide revolve around a central objective---only containing the main idea or a pertinent question.
Some supporting evidence can, and often should, be included.
By adhering to this principle, we ensure clarity and prevent information overload.

This often takes the form of chunking or breaking down complicated topics in scientific presentations.
You would build understanding by building on your audience's common foundation or knowledge.
[Scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding) is another way to think about this.

This strategy simplifies comprehension and facilitates better organization and fluid storytelling within the presentation.

## One minute per slide

When delivering a presentation, try to discuss each slide for only one minute.
This guideline serves as a practical approach to maintaining audience engagement.
Doing so ensures that they remain attentive and receptive to your message.

If you find yourself repeatedly going over one minute for a particular slide, it could indicate that it is overloaded with information.
Consider whether some or all information is needed.
Ask yourself, "If I remove this slide, will the audience still be able to understand my main points?"
If no, then turn the slide into smaller chunks.

By adhering to this guideline, you can streamline your presentation.
It will keep it concise, engaging, and effective.

## Put your slide's takeaway as your heading

The heading serves as a crucial element of every slide.
Use this to your advantage.
Put your key message or takeaway as your heading so the audience can grasp the central message at a glance.
This strategic structuring optimizes the comprehensibility and impact of your presentation.

## Only include essential information

It is essential to recognize that the audience's attention is not selective.
Their focus will naturally scan the slide and focus on things they do not understand or are flashy.
If a visually captivating element is introduced on the slide, there is a strong chance they will not notice what you are saying.
Prioritize a clean and elegant slide design that supports your words for the next 45 seconds or so.

## Give credit

Include precise citations at the bottom of your slides.
If multiple sources are on the slide, include a footnote-style reference number or put it beneath the relevant figure or table.
This upholds academic integrity and allows your audience to verify and delve deeper into your material.

In some circumstances, acknowledge individuals responsible for the work on that slide.
It credits their contributions, humanizes science, and enhances transparency.
