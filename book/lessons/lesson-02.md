## Learning objectives

This lesson plan is designed to actively engage students in developing essential reading and comprehension skills for primary scientific literature.
It incorporates various activities to ensure students understand and practice the concepts hands-on.
By the end of the session, students should feel more confident in their ability to read and critically evaluate research articles in computational biology.

- Use skimming and scanning techniques.
- Apply annotation, highlighting, and note-taking methods.
- Identify research questions, hypotheses, and objectives.
- Evaluate the significance and relevance of scientific studies.
- Create concise summaries by synthesizing key information.

## L1 - Speed-reading techniques

**Duration:** 5 minutes

### Rationale

Skimming and scanning techniques help you adsorb critical points and save time.
Speed-reading techniques also assist in determining if more thorough, active reading is beneficial.

### Content

Scientific literature can be time-consuming to read, with dense concepts and jargon.
Understanding an entire article can take hours, depending on your initial grasp of the subject.
People use speed-reading techniques to get an overview of the article to determine if the time investment is worth it.

#### Subvocalization

Subvocalization, often called silent speech, represents the internal dialogue during reading.
It audibly reproduces the words as they are read, facilitating the mind's access to meanings and aiding in comprehension and retention, potentially lightening the cognitive burden.
Subtle movements in the larynx and other speech-related muscles characterize this inner speech.
Unless aided by specialized equipment, readers remain unaware of these movements.

The relationship between subvocalization and reading speed remains a subject of debate.
Speed readers typically argue that subvocalization hinders processing speed and endeavors to eliminate it during reading.
Furthermore, some studies suggest that subvocalization can enhance reading comprehension {cite}`rayner2012psychology`.

#### Scanning

Scanning is a valuable technique for extracting essential information and ideas.
This method involves swiftly moving your eyes down a page, pinpointing specific words and phrases to uncover particular answers or grasp the fundamental main idea.
It can also assist in assessing whether a new resource will address your questions effectively.

To effectively scan, follow these steps:

- Search for keywords individually while navigating the passage.
- Rapidly scan the passages until you locate the keyword you are searching for.
- Carefully read the surrounding material to ascertain if you have found the necessary information.

#### Skimming

Skimming is a reading method that provides a rapid text overview, emphasizing identifying main ideas and key points.
Here are some strategies that you can use specifically for skimming primary literature:

- Begin by reading the research paper's or article's abstract to grasp the core objectives, methods, and findings.
- Focus on section headers and summaries to quickly identify the paper's organization and locate key points.
- Jump to the results and conclusion sections for a concise overview of the study's outcomes and the author's final remarks.
- Pay attention to figures, tables, or visual representations, as they often encapsulate critical data and trends.
- Highlight and recognize essential keywords and phrases that convey the central themes and concepts of the research.

## A1 - Reading for gist

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Lead [this activity](activity:read-for-gist).

## D1 - Active reading techniques

**Duration:** 5 minutes

### Rationale

Teaching active reading techniques for scientific literature is driven by compelling reasons.
First, it helps students efficiently navigate dense and complex information commonly found in scientific articles.
Active reading methods enhance comprehension by engaging readers in deeper interactions with the text, encouraging them to question, summarize, and visualize content.
These techniques also foster critical thinking as readers analyze, evaluate, and apply the information, preparing them for success in academia and research.

### Content

Open up a [Top Hat](https://app.tophat.com) anonymous discussion question and have students submit their techniques to assist their reading comprehension.

Below is a list of some possible active reading techniques students can use.
Demonstrate a few of these techniques with examples in a presentation format.

- **Preview the text:**
  Before diving into the article, scan the title, abstract, headings, subheadings, figures, and tables.
  This preview provides an overview and helps you identify the main topics and key points.
- **Highlight and annotate:**
  Use highlighting or underlining to mark important passages, key terms, and evidence.
  Write brief annotations or comments in the margins to clarify your understanding or ask questions.

  ```{warning}
  Use highlighting and annotation sparingly.
  It rarely helps solidify your understanding of an article.
  It is beneficial when you are reviewing an article to refresh its content.
  ```

- **Summarize paragraphs:**
  After reading a paragraph or section, pause and summarize it in your own words.
  This influences you to process and internalize the information before moving on.
- **Ask questions:**
  Formulate questions as you read.
  What is the research question?
  How was the study conducted?
  What are the main findings?
  Asking and answering questions actively engages your critical thinking.
- **Pause and reflect:**
  Periodically pause and reflect on your reading.
  Consider how the current section relates to the overall research or the paper's central argument.
- **Make connections:**
  Relate the new information to your existing knowledge or experiences.
  Connecting new content to what you already know enhances comprehension and retention.
- **Challenge yourself:**
  When facing unfamiliar terms or concepts, challenge yourself to look them up or seek additional resources to gain a deeper understanding.
- **Discuss with peers:**
  Discuss the article's content with classmates or colleagues.
  Sharing perspectives and insights can clarify your understanding and uncover different interpretations.
- **Revisit and review:**
  Revise your notes and annotations after completing the reading.
  Summarize the main points and key takeaways.
  Revisiting the material improves retention.
- **Teach or explain to others:**
  Share what you've learned with someone, such as a peer or mentor.
  Teaching or explaining concepts to others reinforces your understanding.
