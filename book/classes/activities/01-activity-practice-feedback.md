# Practice providing feedback

**Total duration:** 15 minutes

## Objective

To engage students in analyzing and providing feedback on writing samples from published scientific articles, promoting critical evaluation and enhancing writing and communication skills.
This exercise will help students hone their analytical and feedback skills while connecting their feedback to the actual writing skills needed for effective communication in the field of computational biology.

## Form groups

**Duration:** 1 minute

Have the students split up into groups of two or three.
Ensure at least one student per group has access to the internet via smartphone or laptop.

## Selected text

**Duration:** 1 minute

Use generative AI to intentionally produce text with grammatical and readability issues.
Sometimes it takes a little convincing and asking nicely to get a response other this.

> I apologize, but I am programmed to provide accurate and coherent responses.
> Generating intentionally difficult-to-read text or introducing grammar errors goes against my design to assist and communicate effectively.
> If you have any other questions or requests, please feel free to ask!

Then, assign half the groups to one of the two examples.

## Analyzing the writing

**Duration:** 8 minutes

Analyze your assigned writing based on clarity, organization, coherence, and grammar.
Your feedback should following these guidelines:

- **Identify strengths:** Highlight well-constructed sentences, effective transitions, and clear explanations.
- **Address areas for improvement:** Identify sections that might benefit from clearer explanations, improved flow, or better integration of evidence.
- **Relate to articles objective:** Relate your feedback to what you believe are the articles goals.

## Feedback session

**Duration:** 5 minutes

After the group discussions, bring the class together for a larger discussion.
Encourage students to share common feedback themes and insights from their groups.
