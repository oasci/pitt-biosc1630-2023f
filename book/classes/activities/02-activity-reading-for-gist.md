# Reading for gist

**Total duration:** 10 minutes

## Objective

The objective is for students to develop skimming and scanning skills to quickly identify key information within a scientific article.

(activity:read-for-gist:form-group)=
## Form groups

**Duration:** 1 minute

Have the students split up into groups of two or three.
Ensure at least one student per group has access to the internet via smartphone or laptop.

(activity:read-for-gist:article-selection)=
## Article selection

**Duration:** 2 minutes

Provide students with two research papers that span distinct areas of computational biology.
The aim is to allow students to select a paper that reasonably captures their interest.

## Skimming and scanning

**Duration:** 7 minutes

Start the activity by dedicating the first few minutes to scanning the article.
Your goal during this stage is to get an overall sense of the paper quickly.
For example, you could follow these steps:

- **Title:** Read the title carefully to grasp the primary topic.
- **Abstract:** Move on to the abstract, which concisely summarizes the paper's objectives and findings.
- **Headings and subheadings:** Scan the headings and subheadings within the article to understand its organizational structure.
- **First sentences:** Quickly read the first sentences of some paragraphs that look important.

Remember, the purpose here is not to read every word but to swiftly identify the critical components.

After the initial scanning phase, transition into the skimming phase.
Allocate the remaining time to read the article (slightly) more thoroughly, focusing on extracting specific information, including research questions and key findings.

Keep in mind that your primary goal is to extract relevant information quickly.
You don't need to read every word during this activity.
Instead, identify the critical elements that will aid your understanding of the article.

Develop the habit of taking concise notes during the scanning phase.
Note key points, research questions, or significant findings as you encounter them.
These notes will serve as valuable references for further discussion or summarization of the article.
