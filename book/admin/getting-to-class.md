# Getting to class

Class will be held in room 206 Eberly Hall.

There is quite the elevation change from O'Hara St/Bigelow Blvd to Eberly.
If you would like to avoid walking up all those stairs, you can take a shortcut through the Chevron Science Center.
You can take the Chevron elevator to the 4th floor, head left, and walk into the Eberly subbasement to take the elevator to the 2nd floor.
Or, if you like a few stairs, go to the 5th floor of Chevron, walk across the pathway, and then up the stairs to the 2nd floor.
