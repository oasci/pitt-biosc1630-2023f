# Midterm OMET evaluations

The following passages are unmodified student responses (13 out of 21) to a Midterm Course Survey administered by [OMET](https://teaching.pitt.edu/omet/).

## Survey

### What is helping you to learn in this class?

- The different activities.
- I think working with certain articles in portions is definitely beneficial for this class.
- I really like and appreciate the organization of the class with Alex’s use of his website.
  I think it’s been really helpful to see what we’re doing each week ahead of time.
- Alex is very good at explaining things in a way that actually makes sense.
- The discussion style and lots of group work make the class enjoyable to learn.
- I enjoy hearing the perspective of a recent PhD student and hearing about actual research.
- I think the group activities that we do every class are very helpful.
- I like the activities.
  It's a long class so for normal lecture–style things its hard not to zone out.
- Class activities!
  Also, the presentations are extremely informative and we are given a bunch of helpful resources!
- I think that focusing on discussing a part of the research paper in each class helped my understanding and learning.
  As well as being able to hear different perspectives from other classmates helped me to think more.
- The teacher's willingness to meet with me and have personal discussions about the class materials and activities
- The lectures are helping a lot.
  I like that we are doing activities in order to better understand scientific literature.

### What is making learning difficult? (structure of class)

- Sometimes having to present in class for activities.
- I think the massive presentation and writing assignments are daunting, but I know that's just how the structure of the class is required to be.
- I think just the disconnect between each week because there’s so much time in between classes.
  It feels like I sometimes put this class on the back burner just because I have so many other assignments.
- Some of the papers have just been difficult to understand, especially if we don't have a lot of time to understand it and ask questions.
- It is too long.
  2.5 hours is too long to stay focused and making meaningful connections.
- Sometimes the activities feel a bit redundant.
  I feel as though at some times too much time is given for discussions but at others too little.
- I'm not sure what to do with assignments or even the activities. I don't know what you are looking for.
  Also I have no idea how you find all these papers so easily.
- The timing of the class is really long unfortunate, it's a very long class structure and sometimes it becomes difficult to stay focused.
- I think that although reading research papers is great, I didn't make it my hobby because of my previous classes or my free time.
So at the beginning of the semester, reading and understanding a different research paper each week was something I found difficult
- The structure if the class works fine for my learning style.
- Nothing in particular is making learning difficult in class.

### What changes could be made to help you learn?

- No changes needed.
- I like the class format that we have.
- Honestly not sure.
- It could be fun to have a story time where you read a paper with us and walk through what you look for and how you go about it.
- I don't take much away from the in-class presentations, they are a bit stressful without much benefit
- Examples would be nice.
- Perhaps taking 2 breaks (a 5min one and a 10min one) instead of just one
- I think using Perusall is very useful and allows me to see some helpful explanations very quickly
- Maybe incorporating some journal club discussions instead of always doing the in class activities.
  I take really long to digest scientific literature so sometimes the activities are a little fast paced for me.
- N/A
- Possibly looking at papers that are reviewing or critiquing another paper so we can get a better understanding of how to write our final paper and what to include in it.

### What do you still find confusing or unclear? (content of material)

- Nothing.
- N/A
- I’m still not 100% how our paper review presentations are going to go.
- N/A
- Unsure.
- Reading these papers feels like I have never learned anything ever, but that's just how that goes with these.
- Creating GOOD presentations! I feel like it's so important, but I'm still not fully able to do it.
- At the moment I don't have any confusion about the whole course, but may have doubts about the review paper later on
- Nothing in particular.
- Some of the procedures that are used in the papers are hard to follow along with, but it's easy to research these unclear points outside of class.

### What steps could you take to improve your own learning in this course?

- Be more proactive about reading papers before class.
- N/A
- Putting in more time outside of class to prepare.
- Read more thoroughly.
- I could take more time for reading the articles.
  However, I struggle with finding a good in between for reading completely in-depth vs skimming.
- I need to do more of the readings beforehand.
- I could take more initiative and go back and explore the website, I think that it has been created with so much care and we have so many resources available.
- I think I will plan my time well to read the research paper I choose and then understand it.
  As well, I will use school's writing center as a resource to help me in structuring my review paper.
- Spending more time outside of class reading the papers discussed in class.
- I think reading more papers outside of class would be beneficial to better understand comp bio jargon and the methods that
researchers use.
