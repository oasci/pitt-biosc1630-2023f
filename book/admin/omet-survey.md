### What did you like best about how the course was taught?

- Alex adapted to the feedback and took action fairly early and quickly.
- I appreciated and valued how prepared the professor was for each and every class. Having everything set and laid out on a Github website made it clear and easy for me to find where and what we were doing beforehand. I thought especially in a writing class, it was extremely helpful to have all sorts of resources in an organized fashion.
- I liked how for the final paper we had multiple drafts to gain feedback
- I liked how the entire course was structured, from start to finish learning how to effectively read scientific papers. Then on to researching and picking our topics. To then write our final paper. While it was an over two–hour class having a break every hour made it much easier to concentrate and learn while in the classroom as well.
- I loved the open and honestness of the classroom teaching style. There was a lot of information provided for every assignment, and we had an ample amount of help and resources.
- I liked that a lot of the activities were more conversational and that the entire class was in a conversational format.
- I liked how non rigid it was. There was certainly a lot of preset assignments however I really liked being able to give feedback that altered the content covered in the class.
- I liked the structure of this course a lot. In the beginning, we learned about how to read and critique research articles, which set us up for our presentations and final papers later on.
the paper was broken up by drafts and not just one big grade at the end
- I liked the fact that the course and instructor were adaptable and listened to what the students needed
- I liked the presentations and paper that we had to write, I feel that it has developed my skills in those areas
- I enjoyed the interactive coursework in class. The programs helped me gain more insight into the course itself.
- I liked the way the presentations were done. I felt liked I was able to comprehend and actually understand what was being thought in the class.
- I liked the smaller class size because it gave me opportunities to ask questions and really be involved in the discussions
- I like this class because it can urge me to read the research paper. And each part can be analyzed, which is very helpful in the future work or continue to study.
- I liked how the assignments were clearly outlined at the start of the course, and how the class itself is more–so spent doing group activities and supplemental.
Alex was very open to suggestions and ran the class based on feedback given during the class.
Generally, I liked how the course was laid out with the giant paper over the semester along with the presentation.

### If you were teaching this course, what would you do differently?

- I would probably not include such a large volume of papers to read, but instead focus on one paper. This way the analysis process becomes much easier and it doesn't feel like time was wasted reading multiple papers that were not particularly useful. Techniques can always be demonstrated with one paper.
- We did end up doing a variation of this, but I wish we could have a set in stone lecture on graduate school/professional career advice earlier in the semester. Most of the class was applying to graduate schools or jobs and it was honestly super helpful being able to hear from someone in the field who has gone through what we had.
- I would dedicate a whole class to working on paper/presentation so that we can ask questions. It was very hard for me to figure out how to get started
- I cannot think of anything I would change, Alex formatted the class amazingly well.
- I have no input! I though it was taught very well, the class was definitely long and hard to focus in, but the instructor did as much as possible to help.
- I did not enjoy all of the group activities at the start of the semester. I feel as though a broader discussion format or more tophat/canvas discussion posts would be more engaging for everyone.
- Maybe more smaller group discussions about papers.
- I think I would spend a little time teaching students where to find credible research papers and also talk about the many different fields that these research papers can cover. I know that this class is computational biology, but it would be interesting to talk about papers pertaining to computational neuroscience, chemistry, immunology, etc., since they have some degree of overlap.
- include some mini hw presentations to practice and get used to presenting.
- I do not think there is anything I would do differently for this class
- Maybe break it up into two different days
- Nothing much
- nothing
- If I were teaching this class, I would break the same papers into sections and move on to a new paper after one, rather than using a new study for each section of the research. Also, the grading for this lesson is a little different than my other writing lessons, where it is more based on right or wrong opinion. I may change the grading a little bit.
- I may focus more on how to present and how to write. I know that is difficult to do given its very subjective, but some more guidance on that front, given that it is the majority of the grade comes from those two things, would be helpful.
- The class is too long. If the goal is to teach us how to read and write about scientific literature, it could be done better with a shorter class period where we read something at home and talk about it in class. I have a hard time reading during class because there are too many distractions, so this approach would have been better for me.
- Alex's grading standards were tougher than those in other writing–intensive courses. Therefore, preparing for my presentation and writing my paper was more stressful than expected. In addition, I believe this course should primarily focus on evaluating students' understanding of their papers and observing their progress throughout the term.
- If you asked me what I learned from this class I could barely give you a list. I didn't understand the purpose of the class I wish that this was an elective rather than required because I think that students who want to go into academia should take this course, but others like myself who would want more of an industry focus where you could be working on actual projects or something that could give them experience in the field would've been better.

### Are there any specific areas or topics in which you feel I excelled as an instructor or any areas where I could have been more effective?

- You gave great feedback whether it was for assignments in class or for our questions regarding post–graduation plans (grad school or work). Especially being so close in age to us I think is something you should use to your advantage and can make your future semesters great. It just makes it easier to talk to you as a person and professor since you were in our shoes not too long ago.
- I think the general inclusivity and mindfulness of all students was excellent. I feel like for such a small class, we may have benefited from required individual meetings at some point. I have had professors cancel a class and replace the class time with some one on one meetings around the midpoint in the semester.
- NA
- I believe you excelled at helping us understand the research papers better and how to effectively read scientific literature. I believe the only area that could have been more effective is explaining the purpose and how exactly to write the final paper, as I wasn't entirely sure what I was supposed to write until the second draft (I was also writing similarly to the unofficial microbiology papers).
- you were very good at engaging with the class. it made speaking in front of everyone easier.
- I think you did a very good job of giving feedback and being available for students
- No
- The beginning of the class work.
- no
- I really enjoyed how honest you were as an instructor and the relaxed environment you were able to provide. Going to class can be stressful but I did not feel that with this class because I felt comfortable participating.
- Communication!
- I think the small in class activities we would do were effective.
- N/A

### Is there anything else you'd like to share regarding my teaching style or my role as your instructor in this course?

- Keep your style of teaching. You were very approachable and kind which made it much easier to engage with you and participate in class and with my classmates.
- I really enjoyed how you incorporated your other interests into the class content. The graphic design stuff was cool to see. I though you were very approachable and a great knowledge base for students trying to figure out their post–undergrad plans.
- I liked how comfortable the environment was. It felt more interpersonal which facilitated more learning.
- You looked out for the students' best interests by extending deadlines and providing thoughtful feedback, this was a very nice thing to do for us.
- :)
