# Drop-in discussions

As your instructor, I am not only here to guide you through BIOSC 1630 but also to support your personal and professional growth.
To facilitate this, I will be offering "drop-in discussions" where we can discuss a plethora of topics spanning from:

- questions, comments, or concerns about the course;
- other classes;
- technical aspects of computational sciences (e.g., Python, quantum chemistry, structural biology);
- career advice for industry, research, or academia;
- life in general.

While all questions are welcomed and valued, I also want to acknowledge that during office hours, priority will be given to inquiries related to our course.
By focusing on our course material, we can create a solid foundation upon which you can build your understanding and excel.

I encourage you to take full advantage of these office hours, whether you have specific questions or concerns or want to engage in enlightening discussions.
Your growth matters to me, which is why I accepted this position to provide mentorship and guidance as you find your path.
Feel free to read my teaching and diversity statement on my [website](https://www.aalexmmaldonado.com/) to learn more about my experiences and mindset.

Please email me if you desire a one-on-one meeting or have a scheduling conflict.
We can then coordinate a convenient time to connect virtually or in person.

## Time

Drop-in discussions will be on Thursdays from 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM.

## Location

I will be in 315 Clapp Hall during the allotted time.
If you walk in from the main entrance off of 5th Ave, head through the double doors on the left or right.
Go down a few steps and find the elevator at the hallway intersection.
Take the elevator to the 3rd floor.
Turn left after exiting the elevator, and the room is right there.
