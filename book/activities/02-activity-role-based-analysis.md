# Role-based analysis

**Total duration:** 65 minutes

## Objective

This activity aims to delve into the scientific paper's content by assigning students to embody different viewpoints.
This exercise fosters a nuanced understanding of the research, encourages critical thinking, and demonstrates the diversity of perspectives involved in scientific discourse.

## Form groups

**Duration:** 0 minutes

Groups should already be formed from [here](activity:active-reading:form-group).

## Article selection

**Duration:** 0 minutes

Students should have selected an article from [this activity](activity:active-reading:article-selection) beforehand.

## Roles

**Duration:** 2 minutes

Assign each group a specific role closely related to the scientific article.

- The author(s) of the paper.
- A critic who is skeptical of the paper's methodology or conclusions.
- A policymaker tasked with considering the paper's implications.
- A member of the general public interested in the research.

```{note}
Some groups may need to merge to have an equal distribution of these four roles.
```

## Preparation

**Duration:** 15 minutes

Within your designated groups, engage in thoughtful discussions to understand your assigned roles.
This involves delving into your characters' motivations, interests, and concerns.
Moreover, it involves extracting relevant information from the scientific article to substantiate your role and formulate a perspective or opinion that aligns with your character's viewpoint.

Your primary objective is to craft a brief yet informative presentation that captures your role's distinctive perspective.
Incorporate visuals, employ bullet points, and spotlight essential information to convey your viewpoint precisely.

As your group prepares to present your perspectives, remember the following instructions and guidelines to ensure an effective and engaging presentation.

  Respect the time limit allocated for your group's presentation: 5 minutes.
  Effective time management ensures that all groups can share their perspectives equally.
- **Clarity and conciseness:**
  Begin by introducing your role and its relevance to the scientific article.
  Clearly state your character's motivations, interests, or concerns about the research.
- **Key information:**
  Highlight key information from the article that supports your role's perspective.
  Emphasize crucial findings, methodologies, or implications that align or clash with your character's viewpoint.
- **Role immersion:**
  Immerse yourselves in your assigned roles during the presentation.

```{tip}
The goal of this activity is not to know who can make the prettiest slides.
Your aim should be to effectively communicate how their role could interpret this article, given their perspective.
```

This activity allows you to practice presenting while enabling you to effectively communicate your role's perspective on the scientific article to your classmates.

## Presentation

**Duration:** 45 minutes

Each group will present their slides for 5 minutes.

## Reflection

**Duration:** 3 minutes

As we wrap up the activity, we will engage in a reflective session to understand how adopting different roles has influenced our perceptions of the scientific article.
This moment of introspection encourages us to contemplate the diversity of perspectives that surfaced during the exercise and how this mirrors the intricate nature of scientific research.
It highlights the importance of considering various viewpoints when evaluating research, acknowledging that a comprehensive understanding often arises from embracing a multitude of angles.
By reflecting on these insights, we reinforce our ability to approach scientific topics with greater depth and appreciation for the complexity of the field.
